			<h1>The Workstation</h1>
			<p>
				I'm pretty proud of the work setup that I've built over the last
				year, so I wanted to show it off a bit. Hopefully you find some
				things to incorporate into your setup that you find cool! I've
				linked items that I am a specific fan of. All links are
				non-affiliate and use a
				<code>smile.amazon.com</code>
				link where possible.

			<h2>The Big ðŸŽŸ Items</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial/"
						>
							Uplift 60x30 Sit-Stand Desk
						</a>
					</strong>
					: A huge amount of space to spread out and still have room
					for random packages, food, or anything else I'm tinkering
					with at the time. Also, standing is good for you! (Desk mat
					and standing desk mat come as freebies.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/"
						>
							Herman Miller Embody
						</a>
					</strong>
					: The absolute best chair for working long hours. Comfy
					enough for those long Netflix binge sessions, but also for
					when you need to buckle in and handle a SEV.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PXYRMPE"
						>
							Dell U3417W Ultrawide Monitor
						</a>
					</strong>
					: Who doesn't love to have 3 windows open at all times?! The
					standard layout is Work Chat (1/3), a browser (2/3). VS Code
					and iTerm2 in their own dedicated workspaces for all the
					screen real estate I could want. Paired with the
					<a
						href="https://www.fully.com/accessories/monitor-arms/jarvis-monitor-arm.html"
					>
						Fully Jarvis Monitor Arm
					</a>
					to minimize desk footprint.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>2019 15in Macbook Pro</strong>
					: Company provided. Probably the least important part of the
					Big Ticket Items as most of my work is done ssh'ed into a
					big boy machine.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://smile.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera/dp/B01N3S1J4R?th=1"
						>
							Sony A6500 w/ 18-105mm f4 Lens
						</a>
					</strong>
					: If I have to join a Zoom link on my laptop, or want to
					make a particularly crispy impression, I'll join with this
					as my webcam. Paired with the RODE VideoMicro for audio.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://smile.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q9MJKBV"
						>
							Bose NC700 Headphones
						</a>
					</strong>
					: Not so necessary in the new WFH world, but still unrivaled
					to strap on for heavy coding sessions.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>Accessories To Tie It Together</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Notebook</strong>
					: Probably the most important accessory I use day-to-day. I
					track TODO items for the day, but also meeting takeaways,
					pain points that I can revisit, and I also track my training
					plan here! This one I got for free from my friend Karen.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://portal.facebook.com/products/portal-plus/"
						>
							Portal+
						</a>
					</strong>
					: A dedicated VC machine that provides conference room level
					noise isolation. (Ditch the headphones!) The camera/mic
					follow you around so you can be sure your ideas are being
					heard and seen. I got one for my family at home too, and
					this makes it super easy to stay connected two states away!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4097"
						>
							Leopold FC660C Keyboard
						</a>
					</strong>
					: A tactile topre keyboard that is comfortable enough to
					make me want to keep typing, even when I don't have anything
					to type. Completely matte black for extra style points ðŸ˜Ž
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://smile.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Advanced-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B07S395RWD"
						>
							Logitech MX Master 3
						</a>
					</strong>
					: The top-of-the-line ergonomic mouse by Logitech that fits
					my hand like a glove.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Nanami Wireless Charging Stand</strong>
					: I got this for free from our local Buy Nothing group. It
					plugs into the monitor and makes sure my phone is always
					ready for a long walk!
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>The Real Fun Stuff ðŸŽ‰</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a
							href="https://smile.amazon.com/Training-Climbing-Definitive-Improving-Performance/dp/1493017616"
						>
							Training For Climbing
						</a>
					</strong>
					: The climbing training Bible. I read this before my
					workout, at lunch, or after work as part of "forever
					improving" at climbing.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Tape
					</strong>
					: Sometimes I train a bit too hard before work, and I need
					to tape up my fingers because they're sore.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Glasses</strong>
					: I have a couple pairs: one that's blue-light blocking for
					work, and two for everything else. They are the Manchester
					from EyeBuyDirect and the Burke from Warby Parker.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Vitamin D</strong>
					: Critical in the PNW winters, where the sun sets at 4pm and
					there are less chances to get Vitamin D naturally from being
					outdoors.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fidget/Personal Wellness Toys</strong>
					: I'm a big proponent of "active" fidget toys, i.e. ones
					that you can't mindlessly play with. I keep a
					<a
						href="https://speedcubeshop.com/collections/cosmic-collection/products/cosmic-weilong-wr-m-3x3?variant=31053231063153"
					>
						Cosmic WeiLong WR M SpeedCube
					</a>
					, lacrosse ball, physical therapy putty, and finger extensor
					trainers on my desk for whatever I feel like playing with at
					the time.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The Greenhouse</strong>
					: I like to work around some signs of greenery and life. In
					order from bottom-left to top-right, I have a: Golden
					Pothos, Lemon-Lime Maranta, a Dragon Tree, Asparagus Fern,
					Peacock Plant, and a Gold Dust Dracaena.
