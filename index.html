			<h1>Hey there üëãüèΩ</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Aaroh. I write C++ at Facebook to manage images, videos, and
				basically all large files across our family of apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've also been doing web development for
				<code>{CURRENT_YEAR - 2015}</code>
				years.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're here, chances are you might want to hire me. Here's a
				<a href="resume_aarohmankad.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>
				. We can also
				<a href="https://calendly.com/aarohmankad">
					book a quick chat
				</a>
				to talk more about how we'd make a great fit!

				<h3>
					An Accidental Deletion Pipeline
				</h3>
				<p>
					<em>Context:</em>
					We have accidental data-loss SEVs. Oftentimes, there is a
					significant portion of time investigating which objects are
					recoverable, and then pushing the recovery step by step
					through metadata repair, cold storage restores, etc. This
					project:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						helped automate the restore process by streamlining all
						the necessary steps to attempt to recover the data from
						backups.
					</li>
					<li>
						saves on-call time, prevents human mistakes, and is well
						maintained compared to ad-hoc scripts written by team
						members.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<section id="bulk_metadata_editor">
				<h3>
					A Bulk Metadata Editor
				</h3>
				<p>
					<em>Context:</em>
					We have a lot of blobs. Like... exabytes. Sometimes we want
					to edit the metadata of records in the ~100k-1m range. To do
					that, you would write some filler code in a pipeline that
					was meant to handle
					<em>state transitions</em>
					(i.e. active to deleted), not anything along the lines of
					"If this blob is in this list of blobs, do this edit." This
					project:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						allows an Everstore Engineer to bulk-edit blobs based on
						a simple, declarative binary or extend it to implement
						their own logic (like what is mentioned above). It
						safeguards us from making unexpected changes, and allows
						the engineer to complete a ‚Äúdry-run‚Äù, which previously
						wouldn‚Äôt have been possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						runs these edits extremely quickly in parallel,
						processing ~100k records per minute.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>
					Off-hand efficiency improvements
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Extended configuration on Cold Storage backups,
						decreasing compaction overhead by 35% during high-stress
						COVID load. To quantify this percentage further, this is
						about
						<strong>1.2EB of savings.</strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						Decreased our online queue of pending volume deadings
						from 3M to 300k by short-circuiting from known failures.
					</li>

			<h2>Would you like a side (project) with that?</h2>

				I've written quite a lot of small projects that vary across tech

				have pretty good

				s.)
